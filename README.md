# QuakeLevels
## Catacomb Doom
### What is the project
the project is to make a quake deathmatch map for 2-4 players. The name of my map is Catacomb Doom
### First steps
the first step to this project was to create a theme to base our level around. the theme I chose to go for was a dungeon underground theme/ some kind of temple. I chose this theme because I just feel that that is how quake is supposed to look.
my main inspiration for the aethetic for the map was the Quake Champions map Burial chamber. 
### Gameplay goals
the main goal for the map were to encourage fast gameplay. Mainly the level is built as a loop so that the players are always moving around the map looking for frags
